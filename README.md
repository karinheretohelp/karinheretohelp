- 👋 Hi, I’m @karinheretohelp
- 👀 I’m interested in technology, healthcare, social innovation, accessible design, building new things, and being a scrappy generalist!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about government - I know so little! And brushing up on my data skills.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating new products 🤖, or helping you with yours
